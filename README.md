# Jelly Blower - Match 3 Clone

This is a simple match-3 clone, made for portfolio related learning purposes. The game itself is merely a template version for another Match 3 game, since all match-3 are following the same basics.

## Rules

- You have an 8x8 matrix with 5 different types of sprites to mix with. 
- The player can change 2 sided pieces vertically or horizontally
- if the change results in three or more of the same kind, they disappear
- if the change results on an invalid combination, the pieces return to their places before the change
- When any piece disappears, the pieces above will fall and new ones will assume their place above.
- Pieces can be clicked or dragged.

## The Game

it was done from August 13th to August 18th, 2020. Following the rules of not using any asset that aren't art-related, I'm creating this game and making this repository public.

For the scenes, I've created two separated ones:

- The main menu (_MainMenuScene_) scene, which gives the option to play or quit the game;
- The game scene (_GameScene_) scene, which is accessed by clicking the Play Button on the _MainMenuScene_;

I thought about inserting an Options menu for music, but for this example, that won't be necessary (I can insert it later, if I have time for it).
